## seal-scrape-uni
Utility I put together in node.js to scrape university seals off Wikipedia. 

### Dependencies
Right now the only dependency is node-fetch although this is likely to change with future releases.

### How do I use it?
Responsibly 

### Plans
+ Test with a larger list of universities
+ Refine and centralize into framework
